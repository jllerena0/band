    <h2>Favorite Albums</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Hymns in Dissonance</dt>
        <dd>A heavy album that goes back to their earlier roots, but with a much darker undertone. It's brutal, fast, and heavy. Every song is a banger and you'll hear the lowest vocals a human can do.</dd>

        <dt>This is Exile</dt>
        <dd>An amazing sophomore album that was a staple of the MySpace deathcore scene at the time. This album showcases their technical skills, grooves, and guttural vocals.</dd>

        <dt>Somatic Defilement</dt>
        <dd>Their debut album which most longtime fans love. Its raw production adds to the nostalgia of the 2000's with its dark lyrics that tell a gruesome horror story. It's complex and all over the place.</dd>
